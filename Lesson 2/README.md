Experiment 2.1 – Lucas Series 

It is known that each Lucas series term is obtained by adding previous two term, (a0=2, a1=1, a2=2+1=3, 
a3=1+3=4). Design an application that takes the number of terms (N) of the Lucas series. The application will 
generate the first N terms of the Lucas series, put them in an array and visualize them into a multiline TextBox
when generate button is clicked. If the input value (N) is not filled by the user, the application will show a proper 
error message. Use checkbox to ask user to find average of generated values and show it in a label.

Experiment 2.2 – Fibonacci Series 

It is known that each Fibonacci series term is obtained by adding previous two term, (a0=1, a1=1, a2=1+1=2, 
a3=1+2=3). Design an application that takes the number of terms (N) of the Fibonacci series. The application will 
generate the first N terms of the Fibonacci series, put them in an array and visualize them into a multiline TextBox
when generate button is clicked. If the input value (N) is not filled by the user, the application will show a proper 
error message. Use checkbox to ask user to find average of generated values and show it in a label.
